Over the last months, we have learned more and more about software licensing relevant to Keyspace. We have finally arrived at what we believe is the a good solution for Keyspace and Scalien.

From now on, the Keyspace server and all C/C++ code including the C/C++ libraries are licensed under the <b>Affero GPL</b>, as they were originally. The Python and PHP libraries are licensed under the <b>BSD</b>, allowing you to use them freely with your application as you wish. The 1.2.0 version, which was licensed under the BSD license, has been removed from the site to avoid confusion and protect the Keyspace source code.
