We are releasing 1.0.1 today, which fixes some minor issues users experienced.

<ol>
<li>Keyspace would not start without a config file in default mode. Resolution: fixed.</li>
<li>Keyspace printed a non-informative error message when a directory 'keyspace' was present and it tried to create the database file 'keyspace'. Resolution: More informative error message.</li>
<li>Some Linux optimizations were accidentally removed in the 1.0 release. Resolution: added to 1.0.1</li>
</ol>
