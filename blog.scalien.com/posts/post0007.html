We are releasing Keyspace 1.3, the major addition is a stable Windows port (supports XP, Vista, Seven, Server 2003 and 2008) and includes some minor bugfixes.

For this port we had to port our (readyness notification) event based, networking subsystem to Windows' <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365198%28VS.85%29.aspx">Completion Ports API</a>, which was more challenging than we expected as the intended use for the API is asynchronous I/O, which is slightly different than our model. After lots of coding and one all-nighter we prevailed! I'll share more details in a later post.

The next big step is getting rid of BerkeleyDB. Coding is already on its way and I'll post some details about our storage engine architecture soon (currently codenamed Blocksmith).

Back to work.
