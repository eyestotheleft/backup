The market for distributed computing, also called cloud computing, will expand further in the coming years. According to a recent <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=707508">Gartner report</a>:

<div class="quote">"During the past 15 years, a continuing trend toward IT industrialization has grown in popularity as IT services delivered via hardware, software and people are becoming repeatable and usable by a wide range of customers and service providers," said Daryl Plummer, managing vice president and Gartner Fellow. "This is due, in part to the commoditization and standardization of technologies, in part to virtualization and the rise of service-oriented software architectures, and most importantly, to the dramatic growth in popularity of the Internet."</div>

Many companies already use cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services. We expect that the market for cloud computing will continue to grow, and new players competing with Amazon will be in the market for distributed software to use as building blocks for their own infrastructure.

Some companies, for various reasons, will choose to run their own, private clouds. These companies will be in the market for distributed software to build their private networks. Just as inexpensive PC servers running open-source software have become a commodity over the last 10 years, inexpensive PC <em>clusters</em> running open-source software will become a commodity in the coming years.

Scalien is developing distributed software to meet this anticipated demand.

Scalien was founded by <a href="/ecard/mtrencseni">Marton Trencseni</a> and <a href="/ecard/agazso">Attila Gazso</a>.
