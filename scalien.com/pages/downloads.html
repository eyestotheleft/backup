The latest Keyspace version is <b> @VERSION </b>.

Note that to compile and run Keyspace, your system needs a copy of the freely available BerkeleyDB library. On Debian systems this is automatically handled by the package dependencies. On other systems, please use the packager manager to install BerkeleyDB; it is often called 'libdb', the most current version is 'libdb-4.6'. See the <a href="http://scalien.com/documentation/installation.html">Installation</a> section of the documentation for more.
