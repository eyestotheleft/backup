<h1>Whitepapers</h1>

Whitepapers contain a high-level overview of what a system is, so you can make a smart decision when and how to use it.

<h3>Keyspace</h3>

This is the document that the interested programmer or engineer should read first:

<div class="quote">This paper describes the design and architecture of Keyspace, a distributed key-value store offering  strong consistency, fault-tolerance and high availability. The source code is released as free, open-source software under the AGPL license for Linux, Windows and BSD-like platforms.</div>

<h3>PaxosLease</h3>

PaxosLease is a Paxos-based, diskless algorithm for negotiating leases in a distributed system. It is used for master leases in Keyspace.

<div class="quote">This paper describes PaxosLease, a distributed algorithm for lease negotiation. PaxosLease is based on Paxos, but does not require disk writes and does not make clock synchrony and skew assumptions. PaxosLease is used for master lease negotation in the open-source Keyspace replicated key-value store.</div>
